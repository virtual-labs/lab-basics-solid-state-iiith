  "introduction": "The Basics of Solid State Lab is designed to simplify complex crystalline structures through interactive 3D simulations. From unit cells to diffraction techniques, this lab enables students to visualize and analyze solid-state fundamentals with hands-on precision. Covering unit cells, Bravais lattices (2D & 3D), Miller indices, and crystal symmetries, this lab offers a complete foundation in understanding crystalline states.",
